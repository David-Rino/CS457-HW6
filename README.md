# CS457-HW6

Letâ€™s finishing our food tracker! We want to provide a user with the ability to log
what they eat and see the nutrient values for that food.
Create a program in Python3 which connects to the database you created in
Homework 5. Provide a user interface (your choice of GUI or CLI) where a user
can log the food they eat and see their nutrient totals for a particular day (of their
choosing).
Submit the following:
1. The Python3 code for your program.
2. A pg_dump for the database schema only.
3. A screenshot of the user logging food (and any result you choose to
display).
4. A screenshot of the user requesting nutrient information for a particular day
and the results of their request.
5. A copy of the database logs showing the effects that your Python3
program had on the database.
